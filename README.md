# Lyra Sentiment Classifier (n8n + GPT-4.1 nano)

This project demonstrates a fast and modular sentiment analysis workflow using **n8n**, integrated with **GPT-4.1 nano** via OpenAI Assistant, and routing results to separate **Google Sheets** based on sentiment category.

# 🛠 Workflow Structure

## 🌐 Overview

- 🔁 Loops over multiple short texts from a Google Sheet
- 🧠 Sends each text to a custom GPT assistant for sentiment analysis
- ⚖️ Parses the output JSON (`{ "sentiment": "Positive" }`)
- 🧭 Routes to one of three categories: **Positive**, **Negative**, **Neutral**
- ⏱️ Includes a `Wait` node (500 ms) to regulate API call frequency
- 📄 Appends results to the corresponding sentiment-specific Google Sheet




## 🔁 Parsing Logic (JS node)

```javascript
const parsed = JSON.parse($json.output);
return { sentiment: parsed.sentiment };
```

## 🧠 Prompt used in GPT Assistant

```txt
You are a sentiment analysis assistant. Categorize the sentiment of the input text as one of: "Positive", "Neutral", or "Negative".

Return only a JSON object with the following structure:

{ "sentiment": "Positive" }

Do not add any commentary, explanation, or text outside the JSON object.
```
## 📊 Post-processing with GPT Agent

After classifying and storing comments into three sentiment categories (Positive, Negative, Neutral), we used a GPT Agent to analyze the outputs and generate summary statistics and a visualization.

### 🤖 Agent Prompt

```text
You are an AI agent analyzing three Google Sheets labeled “Positive”, “Neutral”, and “Negative”.
Each contains a list of comments classified by sentiment (excluding the header row).
Your task: count the number of entries in each sheet, compute the percentages, and return a readable summary.

```
📈 Result
Positive: 6 items → 40%
Negative: 6 items → 40%
Neutral: 3 items → 20%

Total: 15 comments

Sentiment is evenly split between Positive and Negative, with fewer Neutral entries.

This final step demonstrates how GPT Agents can autonomously interpret structured outputs, compute statistics, and provide insights in natural language — making the pipeline fully intelligent and actionable.

## 🧪 Usage Notes

- Works best for up to 20–50 texts per run.
- A `Wait 500 ms` block is used after each LLM call to prevent throttling.
- Each sentiment type is logged in a separate Google Sheet.

## 📤 Importing the Workflow

To import the workflow into your own instance of n8n:

1. Go to **n8n.io** or your self-hosted instance.
2. Import the JSON file from `code/Sentiment_Analysis_workflow.json`.
3. Configure your **Google Sheets** and **OpenAI credentials**.
4. Add your GPT Assistant with the provided prompt.
